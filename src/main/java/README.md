My project 0 is a Dental Management System(DMS).
It includes a Model.Model.Patient Callback Request.
Later, it will include a patient form to make an appointment.
The form will have more questions for the patient along with the type of appointment they need.
For example, they may choose an Emergency Visit, Check-Up, or Treatment.

The DMS will also have the doctor and staff access login and view function.
